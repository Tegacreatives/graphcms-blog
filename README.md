The project might not look beautiful or have engaging UI desing but my main focus here<br />
wasn't to create a beautiful UI, it's more about intracting with a headless CMS and working with the data from the headless CMS.<br />
Real Estate blog is a dummy project I created to learn how GraphCMS works using Graphql to query and request data. <br />
GraphCMS is a headless CMS based on graphGL, it allows you create schemas and models which you can use in defining the<br />
kind of data you need to work with any frontend framework.<br />
GraphCMS removes the traditional content management pain points by using the power of GraphQL to make API requests<br />
more efficient.<br />
The blog posts you saw on the home page are dynamically fetched from GraphCMS.<br />
Unlike other CMS, GraphCMS is automatically hosted so you won't need to worry about deploying it.
