The project might not look beautiful or have engaging UI desing but my main focus here wasn't to create a beautiful UI, it's more about intracting with a headless CMS and working with the data from the headless CMS.
Real Estate blog is a dummy project I created to learn how GraphCMS works using Graphql to query and request data.
GraphCMS is a headless CMS based on graphGL, it allows you create schemas and models which you can use in defining the kind of data you need to work with any frontend framework.
GraphCMS removes the traditional content management pain points by using the power of GraphQL to make API requests more efficient.
The blog posts you saw on the home page are dynamically fetched from GraphCMS.
Unlike other CMS, GraphCMS is automatically hosted so you won't need to worry about deploying it.
